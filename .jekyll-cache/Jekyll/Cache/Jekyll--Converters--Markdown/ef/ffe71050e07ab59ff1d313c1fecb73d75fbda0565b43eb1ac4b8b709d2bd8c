I"«<p>Depression is a widespread disease in todayâ€™s societies and is called the â€œplague of our ageâ€ due to its destructive power. Damaging the spiritual and physical health of the person, disturbing oneâ€™s work life, social and familial relations, it is a problem that makes it extraordinarily difficult for people to function in daily life. It is a disturbance that negatively affects every aspect of oneâ€™s life from thoughts to emotions and behaviors, nutrition to sleeping habits, and from work to relationships. It is a state of psychological collapse affecting everyone without distinguishing between rich or poor, ignorant or enlightened, young or old, men or women.</p>
